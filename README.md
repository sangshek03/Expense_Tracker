# Expense Tracker

## Description

This is an Expense Tracker web application built using Html,CSS and ReactJS. I made this simple web application to practice React concepts. It also stores the data in local storage. It facilitates the user to enter his/her Income,calculate his/her Expenses and the total remaining balance. I have referred to Traversy Media's tutorial on Youtube.
